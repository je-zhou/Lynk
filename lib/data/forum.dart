          "I was in your situation last year, I didn't do any extracurricular activities and so didn't know what my strengths or hobbies were. But I knew that I needed to get some experience, so I looked around and found a great community center to volunteer at! Use your Lync dashboard to see what events are near you and if any pique your interest. Try and do ones that are different from each other to cover a broad category. Hopefully then you can start to determine what you're interested or good at. Good luck!",
