In accordance to these concerns, Lynk incorporated has provided a platform for students to solve their worries or motivate and inspire them more for their future. We have made an app that provides events, workshops, and highlight opportunities for the youth. 

>The app contains:
* Event page: contains event information around their location to boost their confidence, skills and performance
* Opportunities: provide job and training recommendations for you with filters that best suits you, suggestions from instructors, and nearby areas
* Community: Discussion page for you to obtain consultation from mentors or forums with your most concerned topics 

>Datasets we used:
* 2021 On Track Survey
* ABS 2021 Census
* Reconnect Program
* Tech Jobs
